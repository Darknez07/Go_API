# Go_API
POST to meetings is complete
The date fomat is **DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS**
or else error will be given
MongoDB also checks for any meeting collisions
Also retrival is well configured but json Output is not there
Possibly BSON output is possible but I wasn't able to convert BSON to JSON object
No external Package is used
Also the GET request of meeting by id and meeting by start and end date is done
But wasn't able to convert to JSON output
The time did not permit me to write test cases
<br>To run the program Do **go run .** in git directory
